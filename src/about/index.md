Hi, I'm Aditya. Possessing a curious mind, I like to experiment with things to know how they work. Currently I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I work on small projects in my free time and blog about it once in a while on this website.

Apart from computers, I have a keen interest in art (check out my instagram profile).

You can find my resume <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/158tU_6gTBIBUaqngFD3fCDqZ6qBgXJ-YlBeTeFeMKXk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>
