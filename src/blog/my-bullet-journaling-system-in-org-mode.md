Recently I discovered [the bullet journal method](https://bulletjournal.com/) of organizing your life, tasks or notes in a simple and efficient way with traditional pen and paper.

This method emphasizes on brevity and intentionality. It helps you keep track of things that you have done and things that you need to do which was not quite possible with my current system. Moreover, my system was not really customizable. I could not just _capture_ my thoughts as they arrived (for which I maintained separate set of files).

The amount of customizing that you can do to the way you organize your thought yet still have them easily accessible despite not having ctrl + f button on a piece of paper was fantastic.

The book also emphasized on cutting away from technology as one of the key aspects of bullet journaling. Having time with your thought, away from distractions, is the only way to focus on what matters. But, this was still not perfect system for me.

Being on a computer is a key part of my workflow. Having to maintain, preserve and carry another notebook is not really quick enough. I wanted something digital. Something that can fit on a phone is really convenient.

## Previous attempts

Before I discovered bullet journaling, I created [destined](https://github.com/aditya-azad/destined). It was a simple todo app that had basic functionality that I needed. But, it was kind of flawed in the sense that it did not keep a record of tasks that were already done.

There are a lot of books that suggest having a record of where you were and seeing the progress that you have made over time is one of the best ways that you can stay motivated and stick to your habits. Switching to bullet journaling was definitely a step up.
